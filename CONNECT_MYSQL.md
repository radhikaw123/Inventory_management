## üîë What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Find Your MySQL Password

Your MySQL password is the password you set during MySQL installation. 

**Common passwords:**
- `root` (most common)
- `password`
- `root123`
- The password you set during installation

**To check if you can connect:**
Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
mysql -u root -p
```
Enter your password when prompted. If it works, that's your password!

### Step 2: Create .env File

I've created a template for you. Just follow these steps:

#### Option A: Quick Method
1. Open Notepad
2. Copy this EXACT text:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
DB_NAME=inventory_db
PORT=3000
```

3. Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE` with your MySQL password
4. Save as: `.env` (with the dot at the start!)
5. Save location: `C:\Web_dev` (NOT in backend or frontend folder!)
6. When saving, in Notepad:
   - File ‚Üí Save As
   - Save as type: "All Files (*.*)"
   - File name: `.env` (with the dot!)
   - Save in: `C:\Web_dev`

#### Option B: I Can Create It For You
Just tell me your MySQL password and I'll create it!

### Step 3: Run Database Setup

After creating .env file, run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
node setup-database.js
```

This will create the database and tables.

---

### Step 4: Start the Server

```powershell
npm start
```

Then open: **http://localhost:3000**

---

## üéØ Quick Summary

**Tell me your MySQL password and I'll do everything for you!**

OR

**Try these commands to test your password:**

```powershell
# Try with password "root"
mysql -u root -proot

# Try with password "password"  
mysql -u root -ppassword

# Try with blank password (just press Enter)
mysql -u root -p
```

When you can connect, that's your password!

---

## üÜò If You Forgot Your Password

### Easy Reset Method:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run these commands one by one:

```powershell
# Stop MySQL
net stop MySQL80

# Start MySQL in safe mode (opens new window)
Start-Process "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqld.exe" -ArgumentList "--console","--skip-grant-tables","--shared-memory"
```

3. Wait 5 seconds, then in a NEW PowerShell window, run:

```powershell
"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysql.exe" -u root
```

4. In MySQL, type:
```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;
```

5. Close both windows
6. Restart MySQL:
```powershell
net start MySQL80
```

Now your password is `new_password` (or whatever you set)

---

## üìù What I Need From You

**Option 1:** Tell me your MySQL password and I'll create everything

**Option 2:** Test your password by running:
```powershell
mysql -u root -p
```
And tell me if it works

**Option 3:** Reset your password using the method above

---

## Next Steps After .env is Created

Once .env file exists with your password:

```powershell
# 1. Create database and tables
node setup-database.js

# 2. Start the server  
npm start

# 3. Open browser
# Go to: http://localhost:3000
```
